Customer complaint has been the important feedback for modern enterprises to improve their product and service quality as
well as the customer‚Äôs loyalty. As one of the commonly used manners in customer complaint, telephone communication carries
rich emotional information of speeches, which provides valuable resources for perceiving the customer‚Äôs satisfaction and studying
the complaint handling skills. This paper studies the characteristics of telephone complaint speeches and proposes an analysis
method based on affective computing technology, which can recognize the dynamic changes of customer emotions from the
conversations between the service staff and the customer. The recognition process includes speaker recognition, emotional feature
parameter extraction, and dynamic emotion recognition. Experimental results show that this method is effective and can reach high
recognition rates of happy and angry states. It has been successfully applied to the operation quality and service administration in
telecom and Internet service company.

1. Introduction
Customer service has been playing an increasing important
role in the competitive market in business administration
in recent years. As one of the routines in customer service,
the handling of telephone complaints from customers plays a
significant role in showing the image of the enterprise, obtaining the feedback from the market, and improving the loyalty
of the customers. Therefore, it has attracted high attention
from enterprises and researchers. The existing researches on
customer complaints mainly focus on the classification of
complaints, record analysis, handling operation, information
management, and so on [1‚Äì3]. However, less attention has
been paid to the technical and intelligent analysis of the
complaint speeches so far. Actually, the customer‚Äôs speeches
in telephone complaints usually carry rich emotions and
provide valuable information for perceiving the customer‚Äôs

degree of satisfaction and studying the complaint handling
skills.
Affective computing was proposed by Professor Picard in
1977, attempting to create a way of perception, recognition,
and understanding of human emotion, which would make
the computer system intelligent and sensitive so as to react
friendly to human emotions [4]. It has become a burgeoning
area of research in human-computer interaction during the
past decades. Up to now, scholars have presented a lot of
methods and models to deal with the affective computing
issues from speech signals [5]. However, most researches are
confined to isolated speeches and contain only one type of
emotion [6‚Äì8]. The speeches in the telephone complaint of a
real case are more complicated because they are embedded in
the conversations between the service staff and the customer
and are embodied with the dynamic changes of emotions
ranging from excitement to calmness [5, 9]. Therefore, an

2
effective technology, which is independent of the speakers‚Äô
emotional changes [10], should be first utilized to precisely
distinguish the customer‚Äôs speeches from those of the service
staff ‚Äôs. On this basis, the conversations in telephone complaints can be segmented into separate speeches according to
their different speakers. In the recognition of customer‚Äôs emotions, the computing method ought to consider the dynamic
changes of emotions in customer‚Äôs continuous speech as well
as the possible noise in telephone communication [5].
In this paper, we first study the characteristics of telephone complaint speeches and then conduct a cost-sensitive
learning technology [10] to identify the different speakers and
separate their speeches from the conversations. Thereafter, a
robust method and signal process are proposed to recognize
the customer‚Äôs changing emotions. Furthermore, affective
computing technology is explored by using support vector
machine (SVM) to process the extracted MFCC parameters.
The proposed method and technology have been successfully
applied to the administration of telecom and Internet services.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, theory
and methodology are introduced as the basis of our research
work; in Section 3, the characteristics of telephone complaint
speeches are displayed and the speaker identification from
conversations is discussed; in Section 4, the analysis method
based on affective computing technology is proposed to
recognize the dynamic changes of customer‚Äôs emotions in
telephone complaints; in Section 5, an experiment is illustrated to show the performance of the presented method;
Section 6 is the conclusion and discussion of this paper.

2. Theory and Methodology
2.1. Emotion Classification and Description. The classifications and the descriptions of emotions have been so diverse
due to the different understanding of people‚Äôs psychological
experiences in a variety of applications. For a long time,
scholars have not reached consensus on the classification
of emotion. However, two types of emotion classifications
have been widely accepted in psychological studies: one is
the classification of basic emotions, and the other is the
description of emotion in dimensions [11].
The basic emotion theory claimed that each type of
emotions has its basic and disparate characteristics in human
experiences, physiological arousal patterns, and the explicit
modes. It suggested that all human complex emotions are the
different combinations of basic emotions. And Ortony and
Turner (1990) summarized the typical classifications of basic
emotions proposed by the scholars in this field, which are
shown in Table 1 [12].
Different from the basic emotion theory, dimension
theory argued that the changes of human‚Äôs emotions are
continuous emotion. It suggests that emotions should be
described in a dimensional space, and the similarities and
differences between each emotion depend on the dimensions
in the space distance. Russell and Peterson proposed the
two-dimensional circumplex model for the sentiment classification, which included pleasant-unpleasant dimension and

the strength dimension. They thought that affective states
can be described by the above two dimensions [13‚Äì15]. In
addition, Wundt put forth the three-dimensional theory of
emotion [16], and he proposed that each emotion is one
part of a continuum and different emotions are mapped
to specific points in a space with three dimensions, among
which, P (Pleasure-Displeasure) dimension reflects a positive
or a negative evaluation such as comfortable or not comfortable and agreeable or disagreeable. A (Arousal-Nonarousal)
dimension reflects the degree of physiological stimulation
and takes some action preparations, which might be active
or passive. D (Dominance-Submissiveness) dimension can
reflect the strength and the desire for the control of a
speaker; it accounts for dominant or submissive position.
The continuous form of emotions in different dimensions is
shown in Figure 1 [9].
2.2. Acoustic Parameters Related to Emotions. The commonly used acoustic parameters related to emotions can
be divided into three categories [17], prosody parameters,
spectral parameters, and sound quality parameters. In the
above categories, prosody parameters such as the duration,
pitch, and energy of a speech signal are the basic parameters
for emotion recognition. Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) parameters usually perform better than the
other spectral parameters and are widely applied to speech
recognition [18]. Sound quality parameters such as format

frequency and bandwidth are effective in differentiating the
emotions associated with attitudes and intentions [19].
Recent experiments have shown that the combined
parameters from different categories can acquire a more ideal
performance [9, 19]. For example, the combination of shorttime energy, pitch, short-time zero crossing rate, first formant, second formant, voice speed, number of voice breaks,
and 12-order MFCC parameters was successfully applied to
the dynamically affective computing on vocal social media
[9]. In order to get the dynamic recognition of customer‚Äôs
emotions, the choice of acoustic parameters should take into
account both affective features and voice features. Based
on the previous research results, we adopt the short-time
average energy, short-term zero crossing rate, pitch, formant,
and 12-order MFCC coefficients as the feature parameters
for speaker identification and emotion recognition in the
conversations of telephone complaints.
Short-time average energy refers to the average energy
of the speech signal. It is mainly used for acoustic boundary
and the ligatures boundary. Short-time average energy can be
expressed as in the following formula:
ùëÅ‚àí1

ùê∏ùëõ = ‚àë ùë•ùëõ2 (ùëñ) .

MFCC is derived from a type of cepstral representation of
the audio clip. It reflects the characteristics of the short-time
amplitude spectrum of speech. Extraction process of MFCC
coefficients is shown in Figure 2.
2.3. Speech Emotion Recognition Algorithm. The main
method of speech recognition includes ùëò-nearest neighbor
method (ùëò-NN), artificial neural network (ANN), hidden
Markov model (HMM), Gaussian mixture model (GMM),
and support vector machine (SVM). Telephone complaints
are continuous speeches in the conversations between the
customer and the service staff with background noise.
Among the proposed methods, ANN can simulate the
complicated relationship between the input and output
variables and utilize the hidden knowledge very well by
sufficient training samples, while SVM has the advantages
of superior stability, good generalization ability, and high
efficiency [10, 20]. We will compare the performances of
ANN with those of the SVM methods in our study.
2.3.1. Artificial Neural Network. A neural network is composed of a number of nodes, or units, connected by links.
Each link has a numeric weight associated with it. Weights are
the primary means of long-term storage in neural networks,
and learning usually takes place by updating the weights.
Some of the units are connected to the external environment
and can be designated as input or output units.
Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is one of the
most widely used artificial neural networks, and it adopts a
kind of error back-propagation algorithm for training multilayer feed forward neural network. Therefore, it can learn
and store the input-output mapping relationships. BPNN is
based on gradient descent method which minimizes the total
of the squared errors between the actual and the desired

output values. In BPNN, the basic units of neural network
are artificial neuron, which are simulating biological neurons
with the simplified structure as shown in Figure 3.
The simplified structure neuron is a nonlinear element of
a multiple input and a single output, and its relationship can
be described as
ùëõ

ùêº = ‚àëùë§ùëñ ùë•ùëñ ‚àí ùúÉ,
ùëñ=1

(3)

ùë¶ = ùëì (ùêº) ,
where ùë•ùëñ is the input value, ùúÉ is a threshold, and ùë§ùëñ means the
strength of weight. ùëì(ùë•) is the excitation function. Typically,
a BPNN topology structure includes input layer, hidden layer,
and output layer.
2.3.2. Support Vector Machine. Support vector machine is
based on the statistical learning theory and VC dimension
theory which is the structural risk minimization principle.
Through a nonlinear mapping, SVM method takes the sample
space to map a high dimensional feature space and makes
nonlinear separable problem in the original sample space
changed as a linear separable problem in the feature space.
When we use the SVM method for emotion recognition,
the selection of kernel function is very important. Four kinds
of kernel function are often used in SVM, which can be
described as follows.
(i) Linear kernel function: ùêæ(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùë•ùëá ‚ãÖ ùë¶.
(ii) Polynomial kernel function: ùêæ(ùë•, ùë¶) = [(ùë• ‚ãÖ ùë¶) + 1]ùëë.
(iii) RBF kernel function: ùêæ(ùë•, ùë¶) = exp(‚àí‚Äñùë• ‚àí ùë¶‚Äñ2 /2ùúé2 ).

to their continuous sound waves. Usually, the speech signals
contain possible noises in telephone communication and the
speaker‚Äôs surroundings, so a bandwidth limited filter and the
50 Hz circuit noise elimination had to be adopted in the
preprocessing procedure [5]. Through the careful analysis
of a large number of complaints, we found that calmness,
discontent, and anger are three typical emotional states
which can satisfy the requirements of service management.
Therefore, we will mainly discuss the recognition of these
three typical emotions.
Our previous study has indicated that intensity, pitch frequency, and spectrum parameter could be used as the prominent feature parameters for distinguishing those emotional
states [5]. For example, someone‚Äôs speech characteristics in
three emotional states (calmness, discontent, and anger) are
shown in Table 2.
From Table 2, we can find that calmness has the lowest
mean-intensity with pitch range below 170 Hz. Discontent
and anger have stronger mean-intensities, and their pitch
ranges expand to more than 280 Hz. In particular, the pitch
range of anger reaches more than 300 Hz.
3.2. Speaker Identification from Conversations. In order to
precisely distinguish the customers‚Äô speech from the conversations, we adopted a robust speaker identification algorithm. The algorithm introduced a cost-sensitive learning
technology to reweight the probability of the tested affective
utterances in the pitch envelope level, which can effectively enhance the robustness in emotion-dependent speaker
recognition as shown in Figure 4 [10].

4. Framework of Recognition

3. Telephone Complaints
and Speaker Identification

Based on previous analysis, we propose a recognition method
of customer‚Äôs emotions in telephone complaints as shown in
Figure 5.
The recognition process includes preprocessing, feature
parameter extraction, and emotion recognition.

3.1. Characteristics of Telephone Complaints. The speeches of
telephone complaints occur in the conversations between the
service staff and the customer. Therefore, the speakers should
be identified so that we could find out the customer‚Äôs speeches
and deal with the emotion recognition of his speeches. In
order to do well in spell recognition, the speeches in conversations will be first cut into a series of segmentations according

4.1. Preprocessing of Speech Signals. In order to improve
the quality of speech signals, the preprocessing aims to
provide successor analysis services for feature extraction and
speech emotion recognition, which may include speech unit
segmentation, preemphasis, framing and windowing, and
detecting endpoint [21‚Äì23].

4.1.1. Characteristics of Telephone Complaints. Because the
high frequency part of the spectrum is relatively small in
telephone voice signals, the preemphasis processing is usually
utilized to enhance the high frequency part of the signals‚Äô
amplitudes. This is frequently dealt with by the first order high
pass filter as shown in the following:
ùêª (ùëß) = 1 ‚àí ùëéùëß‚àí1 .

(4)

4.1.2. Framing and Windowing. Previous studies have found
that the characteristics and physical characteristic parameters

of telephone speeches can remain stable in the period of
10 ms‚Äì30 ms and can keep the short-time stationary [22, 24].
Therefore, it is necessary to split the speech signals into the
time periods so as to analyze them based on the smallest
units. This is processed by a frame with the length of 10 ms‚Äì
30 ms.
Windowing is to select the window function after framing, and there are two factors to be considered, namely, the
shape and the length. Generally speaking, we use three windows: rectangle window, Hamming window, and Hanning
window.

4.1.3. Endpoint Detecting. The main purpose of endpoint
detecting is to use computer technology and digital processing to find the start point and the end point of emotional
information contained in a section of speech signal. The basic
parameters of the endpoint detecting are short-time energy,
short-time average zero crossing rate, and short-time correlation function, and so forth. After detecting endpoints, we
will employ the speaker identification algorithm to identify
the customer‚Äôs speeches and put them into the next step for
feature parameter extraction.
4.2. Emotional Feature Parameter Extraction. Research findings in the fields of psychology and metrics have pointed
out that prosody and voice quality in speeches are the most
intuitive indicators to reflect the changes of a speaker‚Äôs
emotions. Statistical analysis shows that if someone is happy,
he usually speaks very fast and the volume is high. However,
if he is in time of sadness, he tends to speak slowly with
relative small intensity. The emotional features which are
commonly used in the researches of speech signals include
short-time average energy, short-term zero crossing rate,
pitch frequency, formant parameters, and Mel Frequency
Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC), as well as a variety of their
derived variant forms, such as maximum, minimum, mean,
range, and change of the covariance rate [25, 26]. In our
study, we adopt MFCC parameters as the emotional features
because they have very good ear perception features and contain the comprehensive characteristics of speech emotions.
Besides, Mel scale has the advantages of simple calculation
and easy distinguishing.
The calculation of Mel frequency is shown in the following formula:
Mel (ùëì) = 2595 lg (1 +

ùëì
).

should firstly identify the speakers. And it is performed by
the algorithm based on cost-sensitive learning technology.
After detecting the customer‚Äôs speeches, we adopted the
affective computing technology based on BPNN and SVM
methods and recognized the dynamic changes of customer‚Äôs
emotions from the extracted feature parameters of his complaints.
In the management of customers‚Äô telephone complaints,
the typical emotions frequently concerned by the service staff
are anger, discontent, and calmness. Anger and calmness
are not likely to occur simultaneously; then, discontent can
be regarded as their intermediate state. Therefore, anger,
discontent, and calmness can reflect the customer‚Äôs possible
emotion changing period in a conversation and can be used
to evaluate the service effects in telephone complaint management. In speech recognition algorithm, we used BPNN,
SVM methods and cost-sensitive learning technology [10] to
optimize recognition rate.

5. Experiment and Results
5.1. Experiment Data. We took CASIA Chinese speech emotional database and the records from the customer complaint
service center of a telecom and Internet service company
as experiment data. CASIA was developed by the National
Laboratory of Pattern Recognition and Human-Computer
Interaction research group at Chinese Academy of Sciences
Institute of Automation [8]. It has been widely used as the
standard corpus for Chinese language test. In this corpus,
each speech with the same semantic texts is spoken by 2 men
and 2 women in six different emotional tones: happy, sad,
angry, surprise, fear, and neutral. Therefore, it can be used to
evaluate the reliability and validity which are only related to
the emotions [9].
The records from the customer complaint service center
are 252 real speech samples saved as wav files at the sampling
rate of 16 kHz. Each sample contains a whole conversation
process between the staff and the customer with 6‚Äì12 sentences, which includes the dynamic changes of different
emotional states. Table 3 shows the part of ‚Äú.wav‚Äù files that
we will mention in the following discussion.
Figure 6 shows the characteristic value (mean-intensity
and pitch range) of some ‚Äú.wav‚Äù file from Table 3. It can be
seen that the values of anger state are much higher than those
of calmness state.

Figure 7: Framing and Hamming windowing of speech file.

In order to suppress the noises and highlight the main
features of the speeches, framing and windowing are used to
preprocess the samples and transfer the speech signals into
frames. For example, the framing and Hamming windowing
waveform of file ‚ÄúAnger-02.wav‚Äù whose frame length is 240
and the shift is 80 is as shown in Figure 7.
5.2. Feature Extraction. The intensity represents the strength
of voice by the amplitude of speech signals. We considered
the typical complaint situations such as the complaints of
broadband fault and fee deduction of rubbish short messages.
For example, ‚ÄúMy home broadband has gone wrong. When
would you repair it?‚Äù Getting fundamental frequency from
this voice file is as shown in Figure 8.
The 12-order MFCC parameters extracted from the above
sample speech are shown in Table 4 and Figure 9.
5.3. Recognition Results. After passing the test by CASIA
database, we apply our method to the 252 real speech samples
[5]. Each sample includes a dynamic conversation between

the service staff and the customer. The three recognition
methods results were shown in Table 5.
From Table 5, we can find that SVM with combined
12-order MFCC and short energy has the highest average
recognition rate. It can reach 88.60%, 61.83%, and 89.80%
in the dynamic recognition of calmness, discontent, and
anger, respectively. The results also show that calmness is
not a prominent emotional state and may be the neutral
description of customer‚Äôs psychological states. The proposed
method has been successfully applied to the operation quality

combined 12-order MFCC and short energy has the highest
average recognition rate of 80.08%.
In the recognition of speech emotions, six typical emotions, namely, anger, distaste, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise,
have been well researched based on the isolated speeches.
Nwe et al. obtained the accuracy rate of 78% by HMM method
[27]. Bhatti et al. developed a modular ANN and reported
the correct rate of 83% [28]. The hybrid SVM method
with combining acoustic features and linguistic information
presented by Schuller et al. can achieve higher accuracy rates
than HNN and ANN methods [29]. Emotion recognition
from continuous conversations has been a new research
issue in recent years [9, 30]. However, there are few studies
on telephone complaints. Generally speaking, the reliable
recognition rate may be 70%‚Äì80% [9].
Due to its specificity and complexity, the dynamic emotion analysis of customers‚Äô telephone complaints in the real
application is expected for further researches. This paper
provides a valuable reference on this issue. In the further
improvement, the feature parameters which reflect the calm
state may be explored and the quantitative evaluation should
be made to show the strength and its dynamic changes
of emotions. Besides, a knowledge base considering the
differences of the customer‚Äôs gender, age, and other attributes
may be introduced to enhance the recognition rate.

recognize the dynamic emotions in customers‚Äô complaints,
we first employed the cost-sensitive learning technology to
identify the speakers and then utilized the BPNN and SVM
methods to realize the recognition of customers‚Äô dynamic
