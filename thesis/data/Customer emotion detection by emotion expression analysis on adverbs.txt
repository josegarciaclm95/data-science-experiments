Abstract The growing interests of affective computing
(AC) and its implementation in e-business demand
researchers to explore the applications of AC techniques in
detecting customer emotions. Recent studies have shown
that language is powerful in conveying emotions, and a
good understanding of major language features bears great
implications for customer relationship management.
However, the effect of adverbs in text emotion prediction
has only been briefly mentioned in a few related works, but
never thoroughly studied. This paper addresses the gap by
investigating how to detect customer emotions through
analyzing the adverbs in emotion expressions. In particular,
we develop a Japanese adverb emotion corpus, analyze
emotion usage of adverbs, and further derive an adverbemotion lexicon and its rule base. Utilizing these resources,
we design and perform experiments to classify emotions in

1 Introduction
Recent years have seen an increased pursuit of affective
computing (AC) which aims at developing applications
that can adapt to changes according to users’ states and
thereby enrich their interactions, leading to a more natural
and effective usability [1]. AC techniques face many
challenges such as emotional signal processing, computational modeling, and information aggregation. Nonetheless,
AC could offer benefits in an almost limitless range of
applications because emotions play a very important role in
every aspect of our life. A growing body of research suggests that AC has many valuable applications in e-business
[2].
E-business has rapidly evolved in the last decade and
become one of the most exciting and challenging research
areas [3–5]. Information systems have a significant effect
on the quality of IT strategy implementation, and could
affect e-business performance. Effective information processing techniques can help firms to grasp the emerging
opportunities and improve competitive advantages. Hence,
there is a growing demand for insights into new challenges
and solutions related to the development and management
of e-business systems.

Information processing related to a user’s emotion can
be found in many areas of e-business applications. There
are already useful applications in the commercial world of
e-business [6, 7]. For example, the development of call
center speech analytics software automatically detects if
customers sound upset so that those calls can be flagged to
learn how to handle them better. If a customer is vocally
upset, he (she) will receive a higher priority in the call
queue and connect to an agent faster, which can help
alleviate customers’ frustration while managing call volumes in a more efficient way. Consumer electronics
manufacturers often release new versions of their products
with an increasingly complicated user interface to support
new features and improve user friendliness; AC can thus
contribute through improving customer related processes.
Against the backdrop of the growing interests of AC and
its applications in e-business, this paper explores AC
techniques of detecting customer emotions. Emotions
influence customer cognitive processes and online shopping behaviors. In many cases, consumers look for
experiences rather than products, or emotions rather than
use values. A good example is that brands become supplying centers of emotional energy [8]. Customer service is
essentially an emotional process—it’s how the customer
feels about the interaction that matters in the long run.
Therefore, customer emotion detection plays a vital role in
e-business, including customer experience management
[9], customer satisfaction measurement [10], customer
service improvement [11], and etc.
This paper proposes to detect customer emotions by
analyzing adverbs in emotion expressions. Natural language contains semantic information about an emotional
state, which allows us to consider different emotional
elements when we split a discourse into parts of a speech
(e.g., noun, verb, adjective, and adverb). Adverbs are often
used to modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs,
enhancing meaning and adding depth and emotion to a
sentence. In Japanese, adverbs play important roles. The
usage statistics of adverbs in Japanese from two writings
on the use of modern Japanese: “Dictionary of Japanese
language” [12] and “Reality of discourse language” [13]
show that, in the dictionary, the number of adverbs counts
for 1.25 % among all kinds of words, which is only less
than those of nouns and verbs. In the Japanese spoken
language, the frequency of adverbs is even higher, representing 12.2 % of all kinds of words. Therefore, in this
study, we focus on the impact of adverbs on Japanese
emotion expressions. We first construct a Japanese emotion
corpus and then derive a Japanese adverb emotion lexicon
based on it. In addition, we summarize adverb-emotion
features under different linguistic conditions and build a
Japanese adverb-emotion rule base to predict text emotions. Using these resources, we perform experiments of

123

Inf Technol Manag (2015) 16:303–311

sentence emotion classification to evaluate the effectiveness of different adverb features. Our results show the
significant impact of adverbs on Japanese emotion
expressions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 conducts a literature review on prior studies of
customer emotion detecting techniques and language based
emotion recognition. Section 3 introduces the construction
of a Japanese adverb-emotion corpus. Section 4 details the
experiments of using adverbs for sentence emotion classification. Section 5 concludes this work with closing
remarks and future directions.

2 Literature review
We review prior literature along two related research
streams: customer emotion detection and language based
emotion analysis. Summarizing the major findings of prior
studies in these two streams, we then differentiate the focus
of our research and highlight our contributions.
2.1 Customer emotion detection
Traditional methods on customer emotion detection are
largely based on surveys and focus groups [14–17]. The
weakness of these methods is they are boring, time-consuming, and data biased. In contrast, AC techniques
provide a new horizon for quantitative analysis of consumer emotional states using machine learning methods.
AC enables customers’ posture, speech, and facial
expressions to be used, along with their words, for a more
accurate evaluation of their emotion state.
Speech is one of the most important channels for communicating and expressing emotions. Using speech signals,
Morrison et al. [18] proposed ensemble methods for spoken
emotion recognition in call centers. Fischer et al. [19]
designed an embodied character agent named COSIMA to
inspect a customer’s preferences and deal with him or her
via natural speech. Gray described a non-intrusive speech
quality assessment algorithm, capable of making predictions of the speech quality received by a customer [20].
Although speech emotion recognition in e-business has a
promising prospect, there are still some difficulties which
prevent it from being used widely. For example, it is difficult to identify speech with too many noises. Ambiguous
voice is also hard to be classified.
Text is another important channel for emotion detection.
Often being packaged with text analytics to detect emotions in customer communication, speech analysis takes
care of phone conversations and other audio, whereas text
analysis handles all of the written forms of communications, including text messages, email, chat sessions, blog

Inf Technol Manag (2015) 16:303–311

posts, web forums, review sites, and social media. For
instance, consumer satisfaction levels can be measured
from blogs with a linguistic-based emotion analysis and
recognition method [7]. Functioning as the part of a Twitter
client on an Android-based Samsung Galaxy S II, a prototype system can be designed to enable people in a social
network to view symbols along with tweets that indicate a
person’s emotional state [21]. Sentiment analysis [22–28]
is also a text-based emotion detection technique with many
practical applications in e-business, aiming to extract and
mine opinions, views, and attitudes from online reviews.
Text-based emotion detection provides a convenient way to
fully understand what a customer wants so as to effectively
manage the customer’s experience.
In addition, there are other ways to detect customer
emotions; for example, researchers at Samsung developed
a smart phone that can detect people’s emotions. Rather
than relying on specialized sensors or cameras, the phone
infers a user’s emotional state based on how the user is
using the phone [21]. Galitsky and Tumarkina [29] proposed a method using emotional states and mental actions
to justify customers’ complaints.

2.2 Language based emotion analysis
The most important tasks of AC include automatically
recognizing and responding to a user’s affective states
when the user is interacting with a computer. The possibility of using languages to build affectively aware
technologies has gained increasing attentions as languages
are important elements of emotion expressions. Every
natural language has certain means for designating emotional phenomena. The applications of automatic emotion
recognition from languages are growing very fast.
Most previous research studies the role of languages for
emotion expression mainly from a two-dimensional perspective: positive and negative affect, which is usually
referred as sentimental analysis (SA). Most approaches on
SA can be classified into two major classes: documentlevel [22–24] which focuses on producing an overall
opinion from one document; and feature-level [25–28]
which aims to discover feature entities from sentences and
then identify opinions that are associated with each entity
(e.g., a consumer’s opinion on a camera’s photo quality and
size).
Recent studies have demonstrated the power of languages in conveying multiple emotions, and conducted indepth analysis of the language features. For example, Mu
et al. [30] analyzed conjunctions for Chinese emotion
expressions. Sun et al. [31] used syntactic parse and rules
to explore Chinese degree words for emotion analysis.
Quan et al. [32] used word emotion for sentence emotion

305

recognition. Tanaka proposed a sentence structure based
method for emotion prediction [33].
Prior research on Japanese has briefly touched upon the
role of adverbs in text-based emotion classification. For
instance, it is shown that adverbs in Japanese can express
the subtle changes in human minds [34], and their classifications as direct modifications play important roles in
emotion expression [35, 36], as well as in constructing
sentences in machine translations [37]. However, the effect
of Japanese adverbs in classifying different emotions
expressed through sentences has never been systematically
studied. Our research addresses this gap by investigating
the linkage between adverbs and emotions in Japanese. In
particular, we develop a Japanese adverb emotion corpus
and design experiments to test how well adverbs can be
used in predicting sentence emotions with adverb features
in Japanese.

3 Construction of a Japanese adverb emotion corpus
We show the construction process of a Japanese adverb
emotion corpus and its composition in this section. Specifically, we first illustrate the sources for our construction,
then demonstrate the major statistics of the resulting corpus, and finally describe the lexicon and the major
categories derived from the corpus.
Corpus construction is an important issue in the field of
Natural Language Processing. A well-constructed corpus
can reinforce language based development and applications
in multiple ways. Prior research has documented emotion
corpus construction for various languages. For instance,
Wiebe constructed a fine-grained opinion and emotion
corpus (MPQA) in English [38]. Quan proposed and built a
multi-level blog emotion corpus for emotional expression
analysis in Chinese [39], etc. However, emotion corpus in
Japanese is very limited. Our study addresses the gap by
proposing to construct a Japanese adverb emotion corpus
for Japanese emotion analysis and recognition based on
prior related research [40, 41].
The data source of the Japanese adverb emotion corpus
is derived from several commonly used Japanese adverb
dictionaries [42–44]. From these dictionaries, we collect
totally 542 most commonly used adverbs. Some representative example sentences for each adverb are also collected
to illustrate the usage of this adverb.
Table 1 shows the basic statistics of the Japanese
adverb-emotion corpus. Among the identified 542 distinct
adverbs, the total 4,394 occurrences of these adverbs are
included. There are 206 adverb words containing emotions,
and 1,205 occurrences of the emotional adverbs are
observed, representing 27.7 % of all the words in the

corpus. The corpus contains 3,864 Japanese sentences,
among which 3,264 sentences are annotated with emotions,
corresponding to 33.9 % of all sentences.
Each adverb and sentence in this corpus has been
manually annotated with eight emotion categories and the
corresponding emotion intensities. The eight basic emotion
categories include: expectation, joy, love, surprise, anxiety,
sorrow, anger, and hate. The range of emotion intensity
values is from 0.1 to 1.0.
Based on this Japanese adverb emotion corpus, we
further construct an adverb emotion lexicon which contains
687 adverbs in total. This lexicon records three kinds of
information for each adverb: (1) adverb category which
represents the functions of adverbs in emotion expression;
(2) emotion category that an adverb belongs to; (3) emotion
usage of adverb.
According to the functions of adverbs in emotion
expression, we divide adverbs into eight basic categories.
Table 2 shows the definitions of these categories and their
frequencies in this corpus. Adverbs of type 0 have no effect
on the text emotions or emotion intensities. Adverbs of
type 1 and type 2 can change the emotion intensity of a
text. Text emotions get strengthened by type 1 adverbs, and
weakened by type 2. Adverbs of type 3 can express emotions directly. Adverbs from type 4 to type 7 cannot express
emotions directly, but can indirectly affect the emotions of
a text. In an emotional statement, adverbs of type 4 can
express emotions, but in an unemotional statement; they do
not express emotions. Adverbs of type 5 can increase
emotion categories of a statement. Adverbs of type 6 can
express positive emotions with some particular verbs.
Adverbs of type 7 can change emotion categories of a
statement.
In the adverb emotion lexicon, 418 adverbs (counting
60.8 %) are single type, but some adverbs may belong to
multiple categories. Table 3 shows the statistics of adverbs
with different number of categories in the adverb emotion
lexicon.

123

As shown in Table 3, quite a few adverbs (about 39.1 %
in this lexicon) belong to multiple categories, which means
their usages of expressing emotions are more flexible.
Type 3 is an important type because the adverbs of this
type can express emotions directly. Table 5 shows the
emotion category statistics of type 3 adverbs (some adverbs
may contain multiple emotions).
Table 4 demonstrates that the numbers of the adverbs
containing the emotions of anxiety, hate, and love are much
more than those containing the emotions of surprise, sorrow, and anger.

4 Experiments of using adverbs for sentence emotion
classification
This section presents the details of how we design and
implement experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of
adverbs for sentence emotion classifications based on the
Japanese adverb emotion corpus illustrated in the previous
section. Beginning with the description of the setting of our
experiments, we then discuss the results and performances
of different classification algorithms in the experiments.
4.1 Experimental setup
We develop experiments to examine the effectiveness of
different adverb features extracted from our Japanese adverb
corpus for sentence emotion classification. The words in
sentences are employed as the basic feature, while the adverb
categories, the adverb-emotion lexicon, and the adverbemotion rules are employed to extract the adverb-emotion
features for sentence emotion classification. We examine
different classification algorithms for sentence emotion classification, including Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression
with L1 penalty, Logistic Regression with L2 penalty, Ridge
classification, and SVM classification. The effect of setting
different learning parameters in these algorithms for the sentence emotion classification is also discussed.
The experiments performed include close test and open
test. In close test, we train different classifiers on 2,612
sentences in the Japanese adverb-emotion corpus, and
evaluate the emotion classification results on the rest 652
sentences. In open test, we examine the applicability by
training classifiers on the whole corpus of 3,264 sentences,
and test emotion classification on a new test set of 584
Japanese sentences with adverbs. We report the precision,
recall, and F-score of emotion classification on each
emotion category, as well as the overall classification
accuracy with different classification algorithms.
Because we focus on the function of adverbs for emotion expression in Japanese language, sentences without

adverbs are not included in our study. The Japanese words
in sentences are segmented by [45], while the Japanese stop
words such as “に” and “と” are removed.

4.2 Using adverbs for sentence emotion classification
To evaluate the effectiveness of adverbs for sentence
emotion classification, we conduct two experiments:
(1)

(2)

Experiment E1.1: all adverbs are removed previously
from sentences in the training and test sets, leaving
the other words as features for emotion classification.
Experiment E1.2: we keep all the words as features to
train emotion classifiers.

Sentence emotion classification is a multi-class classification problem, which is performed on eight emotion
categories, including expectation, joy, love, surprise, anxiety, sorrow, anger, and hate. We employ the one-vs-others
strategy in this multi-class classification problem, by
training a binary classifier for each emotion category and
predicting the final emotion from the binary classification
results with the highest probability or distance. The binary
classification algorithms we consider in this experiment

include Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with L1
penalty, Logistic Regression with L2 penalty, Ridge classifier, and SVM classifier with the linear kernel.
Figure 1, 2 and 3 compares the precisions, recalls and Fscores of sentence emotion classification with different
classification algorithms in the two experiments.
Experiment results demonstrate that with adverb features, the sentence emotion classification in E1.2 achieves
higher precision, recall, and F-score than word features
without the adverbs in E1.1. By introducing adverbs in
the word features, the average precision of sentence
emotion classification increases 9.32 % in comparison to
the word features without adverbs; the average recall and
F-score increase 10.57 and 10.76 %, respectively. The
average classification accuracy in E1.2 is 59.08 %, which
increases by 9.89 % from the average accuracy in E1.1 of
49.19 %.
Comparing different classification algorithms for sentence emotion classification in E1.2, we find that the
Logistic Regression with L2 penalty achieves the highest
average precision of 63.78 %, whereas the SVM classifier
with the linear kernel gets the highest average recall of
50.79 %. The highest average F-score is achieved by the
SVM classifier with the score of 53.41 %. The comparison
of different classification algorithms indicates that the
SVM classifier could get the best overall performance for
predicting sentence emotions through the word features.
Because the size of our corpus is small in comparison to
the number of features for sentence emotion classification,
we have to introduce a regularization process to conquer
the over-fitting problem in classification. Hyper-parameters
are embedded in the optimization functions of these classification algorithms to control the strength of
regularizations. We run 5-fold cross validations on the
training set of 2,612 sentences in the Japanese adverbemotion corpus to select the hyper-parameters with respect
to the highest average F-scores. Figure 4 illustrates the

To further examine the applicability of the adverb based
emotion recognition, we perform emotion classification
experiments on a new test set which contains 584 Japanese
sentences with adverbs from [42, 44]. All the data in our
Japanese corpus is used as the training set. Emotions are
annotated to these sentences with the same criteria as those
in the Japanese adverb-emotion corpus. The same word
segmentation and stop word filtering are performed on
these sentences to get similar word features as those in the
closed test set.
Hyper-parameters of the classification algorithms
employed in close test are selected from a five-fold cross
validation on the training set, with respect to the highest
average F-scores.
We separate the open set experiment by three
experiments:

Experiment E2.1: examine the adverb words as
features for sentence emotion classification;
Experiment E2.2: examine the adverb emotion features for sentence emotion classification;
Experiment E2.3: examine the adverb emotion rules
for sentence emotion classification.

Table 5, 6, and 7 demonstrate the precisions, recalls, and
F-scores of sentence emotion classification in the open test.
Figure 5 shows the mean precision, recall, F-score, and
accuracy of Japanese sentence emotion classification in the
open test set.
In the open test set, 401 sentence emotions get correctly
classified among the 584 sentences. The classification
accuracy achieves 68.66 %, which is 11.47 and 1.88 %
higher than the accuracies of E2.1 and E2.2. With the rule
based adverb emotion feature, our emotion classifier gets

five basic emotions including love, surprise, sorrow, anger,
and hate that achieves the highest precision scores among
three experiments on the open test set, while the precision
scores on the other three emotions are ranked secondly
with small differences. The recall scores in E2.3 for six
emotions including expectation, joy, surprise, anxiety,
sorrow, and hate, achieving the highest among all open test
experiments, while for love and anger the corresponding
recalls are very close to those in E2.2. Finally, the F-scores
in E2.3 with rule based adverb-emotion feature are the
highest for all basic emotions except expectation which is a

little lower than that in E2.2 with lexicon based feature. All
these results indicate that the rule based adverb-emotion
feature is applicable for new sentences out of the Japanese
corpus, which also helps the SVM classifier achieve much
better emotion classification results than other adverb
features.
As our experiment results have demonstrated, the
quality of adverb emotion features is a major factor for
achieving promising emotion classification results in
experiment E2.3. The adverb-emotion feature falls into one
of the nine categories, including the eight basic emotion
categories and a NoEmotion category since some adverbs
are not emotions in specific contexts.
Categories of expectation, anxiety, sorrow, and hate get
precision scores higher than 90 %, and joy, love, surprise,
and anger achieve around 70–90 % precisions. However,
the adverb emotion rules are found not accurate enough for
the NoEmotion category with the precision of 48.57 %,
which is mainly caused by segmentation mistakes and
other textual features, such as verb tense not being considered in the current system. The recall scores of surprise,
anger, and hate are higher than 90 %, and expectation, joy,
love, anxiety, and sorrow achieve recalls around 60–90 %.
The NoEmotion category gets a 51.05 % recall, which is
lower than other categories. The F-scores on adverb-emotion feature extraction are also promising, with over 80 %
of F-scores for the eight basic emotion categories, and
49.78 % of F-scores for the NoEmotion category, indicating the applicability of our adverb emotion rules on new
test sentences.

5 Conclusion
The effectiveness of e-business systems depends greatly on
the level of intelligence and automation [46–57]. The
growing interest in affective computing brings a lot of
valuable research topics that can meet different application

123

310

demands in e-business. Recognizing when a customer is
interested or bored, stressed, confused, or delighted is the
first vital step for treating customers with respect. There is
a huge growing market for technology that can help ebusiness respect customer feelings.
This study explores customer emotion detection algorithms by analyzing the role of adverbs in emotion
expressions. We first construct a Japanese adverb-emotion
corpus, which is annotated on sentence level and the emotions in sentences include eight emotion categories
(expectation, joy, love, surprise, anxiety, sorrow, anger, and
hate). According to the functions of adverbs for text-based
emotion expressions in our Japanese adverb-emotion corpus,
we divide the Japanese adverbs in our corpus into eight types:
adverbs that can express emotions, adverbs that can change
the intensity of emotions, etc. Then we build a Japanese
adverb-emotion lexicon based on the statistics of adverb
emotions in this corpus, summarize adverb emotion features
under different linguistic conditions, and develop adverbemotion rules to predict text emotions. Our experiments of
using adverbs to classify sentence emotions demonstrate the
applicability of the Japanese adverb emotion corpus and the
effectiveness of the adverb emotion rule base. We also show
that adverb emotion features are significant factors of
achieving promising emotion classification.
In our future study, we plan to extend this work to other
languages including English and Chinese and compare the
impact of adverbs for emotion expressions in different
languages. In addition, we will combine adverbs with
speech features to further improve the customer emotion
detection system.
